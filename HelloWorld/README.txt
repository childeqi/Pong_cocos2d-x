Challenges:
	Setting the Environment:
	I got a hard time with compile the HelloWorld. The first time, it's working. However, after several days, it's not working anymore. Finally, we figured out that the problem is the version of my Java.

	Coding:
	Don't really have many problems with coding part.
	But the thing that confused me a lot is the origin. Without it, the position will be very weird.
	Also, I tried to pass the highscore to the Main Scene, but I failed.
	In addition, I accidently messed up some Upcase and lowercase, which takes very long time to figure out. 
	Accidently deleted something in AppDelegate.h really drove me crazy. 
	Choosing necessary files is also hard...

What I did:
	Main Scene:
		you can choose to play as two players (pretending you have friends...)
		you can choose to play with AI (honestly admit that you have no friends...)
		you can adjust the volume of background music
		you can push the QB image, just for fun... (We can lose the game, but QB has to be dead...)

	Game Scene:
		you can play as two players...
		when the score of player1 (left one) become 5, 10, ..., the ball will speed up...
		you can go back to Main Scene any time you want by click "go back"

	AI Scene:
		you can play with AI (a cheating AH actually...)...
		when the score of AI (right one) become 5, 10, ..., the ball will speed up...
		you can go back to Main Scene any time you want by click "go back"
